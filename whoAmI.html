        <p style="text-align: center;"> Here are some fun facts about me!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I am 20 years old, so I am sadly not a teenager anymore. I have to start adulting soon. </li>
            <li>I was born and raised in a little one square mile town called Albany, CA. Not to be confused with
                Albany, NY (though arguably better), the Albany I am from is connected to Berkeley and about a 20 min
                drive from San Francisco with no traffic</li>
            <li>I have an older brother that is 22, and he now lives in Madison, WI. I find it funny how we both ended
                up in the midwest. </li>
            <li>I clearly love stacking apples.</li>
            <li>I am half Chinese and hald Bangladeshi, so I get to eat yummy Asian food at nearly every family
                gathering.</li>
            <li>I am studying computer science with minors in math and human-computer interaction, though I began
                college as a sociology major. Too much academic reading for me...</li>
