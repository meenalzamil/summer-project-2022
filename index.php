                <p>Welcome to my page! I am so excited to finally have a site to highlight the different sides of myself, which can range from academics and work to creative endeavors and my current obsessions. When I began this process, I viewed this as a short-term project with no design or layout in mind. As I have progressed, I have found a new love of digitally creating visuals using color pallets and images. I now plan to continue editing and re-designing this page, almost as to fit my changing identity as I grow. You will find that many of the posts are in the form of a letter. I have always loved writing and receiving letters, so it only feels right to add that love into this site. Thank you for being here as I discover more about myself!
